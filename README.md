# Overview #

This is an implementation of the Dynamic Relation Embedding Model (DREM) for personalized product search. Please cite the following paper if you plan to use it for your project：

The DREM is a deep neural network model that jointly learn latent representations for queries, products, users, and knowledge entities. 
It is designed as a generative model and the embedding representations for queries, users and items in the DREM are learned through optimizing the log likelihood of observed entity relationships. 
The probability (which is also the rank score) of an item being purchased by a user with a query can be computed with their corresponding latent representations. 
Please refer to the paper for more details.

### Requirements: ###
    1. To run the DREM model in ./ProductSearch/ and the python scripts in ./utils/, python 3.0+ and Tensorflow v1.3+ are needed. (In the paper, we used python 3.6 and Tensorflow v1.4.0)
    2. To run the jar package in ./utils/AmazonDataset/jar/, JDK 1.7 is needed
    3. To compile the java code in ./utils/AmazonDataset/java/, galago from lemur project (https://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/Galago%20Installation/) is needed. 

### Install

**Create virtual environment (optional):**
```
pip install --user virtualenv
~/.local/bin/virtualenv -p python3 ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Install DREM from the source:**
```
git clone https://github.com/QingyaoAi/Explainable-Product-Search-with-a-Dynamic-Relation-Embedding-Model.git
cd knowledgeembedding
python setup.py install #use setup-gpu.py for GPU support
```

**Run example:**
```
cd example/AmazonDataset/
bash exp_pipeline.sh
```

### Data Preparation ###
    1. Download Amazon review datasets from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ (e.g. In our paper, we used 5-core data)
    2. Stem and remove stop words from the Amazon review datasets if needed (e.g. In our paper, we stem the field of “reviewText” and “summary” without stop words removal)
        1. java -Xmx4g -jar ./utils/AmazonDataset/jar/AmazonReviewData_preprocess.jar <jsonConfigFile> <review_file> <output_review_file>
            1. <jsonConfigFile>: A json file that specify the file path of stop words list. An example can be found in the root directory. Enter “false” if don’t want to remove stop words. 
            2. <review_file>: the path for the original Amazon review data
            3. <output_review_file>: the output path for processed Amazon review data
    3. Index datasets
        1. python ./utils/AmazonDataset/index_and_filter_review_file.py <review_file> <indexed_data_dir> <min_count>
            1. <review_file>: the file path for the Amazon review data
            2. <indexed_data_dir>: output directory for indexed data
            3. <min_count>: the minimum count for terms. If a term appears less then <min_count> times in the data, it will be ignored.
    4. Extract queries and Split train/test
        1. Download the meta data from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ 
        2. Match the meta data with the indexed data:
            1. java -Xmx16G -jar ./utils/AmazonDataset/jar/AmazonMetaData_matching.jar <jsonConfigFile> <meta_data_file> <indexed_data_dir>
                1. <jsonConfigFile> : A json file that specify the file path of stop words list. An example can be found in the root directory. Enter “false” if don’t want to remove stop words. 
                2. <meta_data_file>:  the path for the meta data
                3. <indexed_data_dir>: the directory for indexed data
        3. Split datasets for training and test
            1. python ./utils/AmazonDataset/random_split_train_test_data.py <indexed_data_dir> <review_sample_rate> <query_sample_rate>
            2. <indexed_data_dir>: the directory for indexed data
            3. <review_sample_rate>: the proportion of reviews used in test for each user (e.g. in our paper, we used 0.3).
            4. <query_sample_rate>: the proportion of queries used in test (e.g. in our paper, we used 0.3).
